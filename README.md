# pico2w-freertos-ap-webserver-control
This project uses the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W running FreeRTOS to demonstrate multitasking, hardware timers, and Wi-Fi access point mode. A lightweight web server is hosted on the Pico, allowing a client device to connect directly and toggle an LED or adjust timer settings via a simple HTML interface. The project integrates:  FreeRTOS tasks (AP server, serial input, hardware timer)  lwIP networking stack for socket communication  Hardware timer interrupts for precise microsecond delays  GPIO control for LED output and oscilloscope debugging
